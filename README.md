# core-synchronizationObjectsAndReordering
Goes into what memory reordering is, what C++11 Atomic Objects are, Memory Barriers,Semaphores, and the various Mutexes and Locks provided by the Standard Library.

Currently not finished. Has the Reordering and Atomics tutorials done as those are necessary to move onto the Lockless Programming tutorial. Mostly done with the Fences tutorial. What is there is important and is enough to continue to the Lockless Programming tutorial.

Finished the Mutex Objects and Lock Objects tutorials, as well.
